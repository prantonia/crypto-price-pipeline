# Crypto Price Pipeline

**This project is a collaborative beginner-friendly group project** built under the **Beginner Review Cohort 1** of the [Data Engineering Community (DEC)](https://dataengineeringcommunity.com/).  
We're Team **DataForge** — a group of aspiring data engineers learning by building hands-on projects together.

---


This project is a lightweight but scalable crypto price tracking system that fetches real-time Bitcoin and Ethereum prices from the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api), processes the data, stores it in both a CSV and PostgreSQL database, and visualizes it in a live-updating dashboard built with Streamlit.
It can be fully containerized with Docker and can be run on any platform with minimal setup.

Whether you're a data enthusiast, developer, or learner exploring ETL pipelines and dashboards, this project gives you a full, practical walk-through of data engineering essentials.

```

- The pipeline runs every 15 minutes via `scheduler.py`
- Data is saved in a CSV for simplicity and in PostgreSQL for querying and analytics
- The Streamlit dashboard reads from the CSV for quick visual rendering

## Why These Tools?

| Tool | Why It Was Chosen |
|------|--------------------|
| **Python** | Widely used for scripting and data pipelines. |
| **CoinGecko API** | Free, reliable crypto API with no API key required. |
| **CSV** | Easy local file storage for basic inspection and visualization. |
| **PostgreSQL** | Robust, production-grade database for long-term storage and querying. |
| **Streamlit** | Instantly turns Python scripts into interactive dashboards. |
| **Docker** | Ensures consistency across development, test, and production. |
| **Docker Compose** | Allows orchestrating multiple services (pipeline + dashboard + DB) in one command. |

## Getting Started

> You'll need either Python (3.10+) or Docker installed.

---

### Run Locally (Without Docker)

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/crypto-price-pipeline.git
cd crypto-price-pipeline
```

#### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

#### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with:

```env

CRYPTOCURRENCIES=bitcoin,ethereum
API_BASE_URL=https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=crypto_db
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword

```

#### 5. Start PostgreSQL (if not using Docker)

```bash
# On macOS or Ubuntu (example)
sudo service postgresql start
```

Ensure a database called `crypto_db` exists.

#### 6. Run the Pipeline

```bash
# Automatically run at intervals
python scripts/scheduler.py

# Or manually run each step:
python scripts/fetch_prices.py
python scripts/transform_store.py
```

#### 7. Launch the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

Visit [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

---

### Run with Docker Compose

> Best for consistent, production-ready setup

#### 1. Build and Run

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:
- Start the `PostgreSQL` database
- Launch `scheduler.py` in the pipeline container
- Run the Streamlit dashboard

#### 2. Visit the Dashboard

[http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

#### 3. Stop the Services

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.10
- **API**: CoinGecko
- **Storage**: CSV & PostgreSQL
